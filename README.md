DThis GitHub repository provides the 3D printing STL files for a portable peristaltic pump. The original design of this pump is credited to PattysLab and can be found on Thingiverse [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4653708).

A peristaltic pump is a type of positive displacement pump that moves fluids through a flexible tube by squeezing and releasing it in a rolling motion. While there are several model commercially available on the web, we were looking for a compact, portable and reliable design. We made some minor mopdification to the design found on Thingiverse by Pattyslab and mounted it on a battery powered drill.

Thge entire design is very small and lightweight, and can be used to filter several liters of water (or gorup routinely filters 6 liters of hydrothermnal fluids in 3 sterivex filters) while in the field.

A new version of the pumop is currently under design (mark III).
